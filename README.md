# LoanAmortApp
### Loan Amortization App

**Concepts:** Network Applications, Dynamic Web Development

**Software & Languages:** Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, Eclipse, Java

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This basic website was an assignment I worked on and created in a network application and web development course at UGA. We were tasked with building a dynamic website mimicing a loan amortization calculator. It takes the inputs of loan principal, term, and rate. The app then displays a loan amortization table output over time. I have included this project in my portfolio to get a glimpse of my past experiences with web development, but unfortunately, I have lost the correct software and connections to run and visualize the app.
